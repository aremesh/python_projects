# Quickstart guide

To get the setup done so you can run all projects take the following steps.

- In your terminal can go to your wanted folder using `cd`
- Clone the repo and cd in to it:
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/RemcoHalman/python_projects.git
  cd python_projects
  ```
- To be able to run the project I would strongly recommend using a virtual env. You could use the following commands:
  ```bash
  python3 -m venv venv
  source venv/bin/activate
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

Now your all set to go. Just run the code with `python <folder>/<file>`
